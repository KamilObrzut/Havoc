Havoc is an original board game created by Me from begin.

It consists in defeating the boss named Havoc before he floods the land with his minions.
in the Game we gain experience, levels and new items

The game features unique card combat mechanics that we acquire with items.

Due to the size of the project, it was divided into several stages:

Stage 1 (CURRENTLY) - Construction and implementation of the table and combat mechanics.
Stage 2 - Construction and implementation of map and game pawns
Stage 3 - Add enemies and their special abilities
Stage 4 - Add items and special skills
Stage 5 - Tests and Balance
Stage 6 - Redoing the visual layer in terms of the license
Stage 7 - Beta version - making it available to a wider group of people
